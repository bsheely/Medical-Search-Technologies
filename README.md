My last task at MST was to develop a web app to serve as the UI for both MST and all MST customers. Because of my limited JavaScript background, I use the Vaadin framework for UI development. The app was developed using Vaadin 8 and Spring Boot. All code was written using Java 8. MongoDB was the database. Rather than link our backend code as a jar, I was told to use API calls.

Prior to developing the UI, one of my tasks was to create a business rule framework that would allow customers to have their own unique processing rules. One of the business rules that I developed was for compliance. That code is included in the Tools directory. The tools jar, most of which was written before my contract started, used Morphia as the ODM to Mongo.
