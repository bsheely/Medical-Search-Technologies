My last task at MST was to develop a web app to serve as the UI for both MST and all MST customers. Because of my limited JavaScript background, I use the Vaadin framework for UI development. The app was developed using Vaadin 8 and Spring Boot. All code was written using Java 8. MongoDB was the database. Rather than link our backend code as a jar, I was told to use API calls.

The UI contained a total of 19 tabs. Some were viewable only to MST and others were viewable only to certain specified customers. 5 tabs are included as samples.

Prior to developing the UI, one of my tasks was to create a business rule framework that would allow customers to have their own unique processing rules. One of the business rules that I developed was for compliance. That code is included in the Tools directory.
